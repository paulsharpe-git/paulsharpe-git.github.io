apologies that its late. i had a very busy week - and i had a bit of difficulty intergrating the javascript for the background, but it was worth it as it makes a pretty boring website come to life. the main problem was with the layering and i had to change the z-index and positioning of all the elements so that they appeared in front of the scrolling mountains. other than that, hope you enjoy the site!
